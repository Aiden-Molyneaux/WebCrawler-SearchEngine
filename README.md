## Search Engine over Data Crawled and Scraped from the Web
### Overview
This project was completed by Aiden Molyneaux and Patrick Kye Foley for an upper-year 'Intelligent Web-based Information Systems' university course.

In the user interface of the search engine, the user can choose to search over one of two unique datasets at a time. Each dataset was created by using our own web crawler implementation to crawl and scrape relevant pages. The web crawler begins its crawl at a target URL, then crawls over other URLs in the same domain, scraping information, and storing the data in a MongoDB database. The first dataset is called 'Fruits' and was created by crawling over 1000 fruit-themed web pages created by Professor Ava McKenney from Carleton University. The purpose of this dataset is to demonstrate that we have implemented PageRank correctly. The second dataset is called the 'Personal' dataset as it was our choice which domain it covered; we chose to start the web crawl at Carleton University's Wikipedia page.
